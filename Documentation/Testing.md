# Testing

## Automated Testing
Since there is no point running tests over code that has not changed, the current testing suite does not run on project build.
1. Expand the **test** folder located within **src**
1. Expand the **java** folder within **test**
1. Navigate to the package, then package or class you wish to test.
	1. To run all tests, right click on the **java** folder and select **'Run All Tests'**
1. Right click on either the package or class files you wish to test, and select **Run 'class name'** from the menu.

Tests may be run individually via the class files themselves. Currently only non-trivial and pure logic clases possess automated testing.

## Manual Testing

1. Have that first employee clock out
1. Remove an Employee
1. Have an employee attend an event, but fail to enter the right code. Ensure points do not get added.
