## Topics Discussed

During the meeting we discussed with Dr.Rai about what they needed software wise in order to improve their work flow in the shop.
She brought forth some areas in which she felt the help of a new software would be grat. She seperated them into sections
in which cost analysis, sign in/out, and inventory were of high priority. These were the main ones she wanted to make a software for. 
We pitched ideas back and forth on what would be the best way to solve the problems they have. In the end we settled on making a software that
combined all three areas she wanted to make more efficient since they all tied in at some point all together.


## Things Clarified

The plan for the following week was to plan our next meeting, schedule, and to start on making our user stories and clarifications for our 
clubhouse.
