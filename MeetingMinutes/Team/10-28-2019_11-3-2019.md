## Topics Discussed

During the meeting we talked about how we want the GUI to look like. We created a prototype out of index cards on how the program should work. Michael took charge of creating it with input from the rest of us. Chris set up the github to begin to code. Edith made changes to the clubhouse so it can show what we want to accomplish. We has a discussion about student vs admin privleges and what they can or can't access. 

## Things Clarified

The plan for the next meeting is to work on pushing out code. We plan to meet Sunday for a work meeting in which we get a solid start to the project.
