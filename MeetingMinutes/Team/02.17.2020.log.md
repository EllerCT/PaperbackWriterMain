## Week 3, Iteration 4 ##

### Today's Activities ###

- Begin official work of reinventing Cost Analysis for a modular structure.
- Create Material structure.
  - A material is the type of resource, specific resource, and number of that resource that a product will use.
  - Made it so an 'empty' material can be populated given a type easily
  - Made subclassing material to change the method of analysis easier if necessary
- Create Modular Product
  - A modular product, unlike an old product, just keeps a list of materials, total cost, and product identifiers like names and descriptions.
- Mental mapping of new Cost Analysis window
  - Create a MaterialPane class? Add to a JFrame (or InternalFrame), just ready to go?
