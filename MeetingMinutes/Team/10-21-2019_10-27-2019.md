## Topics Discussed

Discussed different types of meetings. Formal meetings are for talking about things planned and clarrifying objectives. Wokr meeting are for working on the code and doing things dicussed in our formal meetings. Formal meetings are planned for Fridays at the end of the week and work meetings are to be planned at the beginning of the week. Talked to our client about the features we have planned and asked if the features we had fit what they wanted. They got back to us and said they were ambitiuos and said that the most important ones they needed where the cost analysis and time clock features as they are now don't have access to TSheets. We asked the professor if we should make them a very basic time clock they could use while we make the finished one for the first iteration.

During this meeting we made changes to the club house by adding tasks to stories int he club house that make them more detailed. The task function creates a sort of checklist for things that need to be done to complete the story. We also addded some new stories based on new information we recieved from the client. We started brain storming ideas for the GUI.
