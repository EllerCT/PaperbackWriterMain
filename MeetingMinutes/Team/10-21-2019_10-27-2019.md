## Topics Discussed

Discussed different types of meetings. Formal meetings are for talking about things planned and clarrifying objectives. Wokr meeting are for working on the code and doing things dicussed in our formal meetings. Formal meetings are planned for Fridays at the end of the week and work meetings are to be planned at the beginning of the week. Talked to our client about the features we have planned and asked if the features we had fit what they wanted. They got back to us and said they were ambitiuos and said that the most important ones they needed where the cost analysis and time clock features as they are now don't have access to TSheets. We asked the professor if we should make them a very basic time clock they could use while we make the finished one for the first iteration. 
 
## Things Clarified

For the following week we will beign working on the skeleton of our project and plan a work meeting to start and be on the same page.
