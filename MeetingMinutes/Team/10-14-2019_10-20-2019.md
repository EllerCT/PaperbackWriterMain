## Topics Discussed

Discussed final details about the first project presentation on Thrusday, and created the UML for the domain to be added to the presentation
The UML creator we used was PlantUML. Once the presentation was done we finished up added things to the github and clubhouse. We also emailed 
our client and asked for a picture of the current way they figure out costs for a book once it is done being made.

first itereation after we present in class.
