## Topics Discussed

During the meeting we talked about when we want to meet with out client for the first iteration presentation. We decided to plan it for the friday
before iteration 1 is due. We will be awaiting a response from our client to see if the time would work for them. We then planned out a skeleton of 
the classes neeeded for the logic behind our project, such as what needs to be done for a button, what can an admin be able to do and so on. The 
classes created during the meeting were an administrator, event, main, student, and a TimeClock. We also created interface
classes such as employee, frontend, IOSystem and Main. 


## Things Clarified

The plan for eveyone to do is to work on some part of the project whether it be the logic or cleaning up the GUI by making changes to the design, or 
working on the interface. To have something done for Sunday, have at least one committ. Next meeting is Sunday to be a work session.
